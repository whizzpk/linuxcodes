I2C
	PLX PCIe_Switch – PEX8603 ( it has i2c interface as debugging interface, we don't test it)
	I2C switch – PCA9548A (we only test modules attached to it,so testing of switch itself is not needed)
	Ublox GPS – Neo 7N0000 (i2c packet size issue, solution is progress ) 
	Temp sensor : unable to read temp, solution in progress
